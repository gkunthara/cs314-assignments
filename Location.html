                     By this point, almost everyone has heard of Coinbase. The company operates
                     as the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. Coinbase is by far the 
                     easiest way to buy, sell, and manage Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Bitcoin
                     Cash. In January, Coinbase was reported to make $2.7 million a day. I wish 
                     I could've invested in Coinbase!

                    University of Waterloo is where the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin,
                    studied. The dude is only 24 years old, and has an approximate net worth
                    near $20 billion!! Unlike Bitcoin's founder who is anonymous, Vitalik
                    has been quite outspoken about Ethereum, cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin.

                     Singapore is building itself as a hub for crypto companies.
                     With their lax business laws, many companies have been moving
                     to Singapore to get away from taxes, regulation, and scrutiny.
                     Some top projects coming out of Singapore include Request Network,
                     & Kyber Network.
