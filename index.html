                This last year, all the latest tech news seem to revolve around cryptocurrencies
                and of course their surging and volatile prices. But most people don't know much
                about cryptocurrencies. Want to learn some knowledge to show off to your friends??

            As its name suggests, cryptocurrencies are an electronic cash system.
            The goal behind cryptocrrencies is to offer people a new, potentially better
            way of completing transactions that eliminates the need for a middle man (i.e. a financial institution like a bank).
            Instead of sending money through a "trusted" third party, cryptocurrencies utilize a cryptographic proof system to ensure
            valid payments. In spite their claims, the name cryptocurrencies is becoming somewhat of a misnomer.

             Bitcoin is pretty special. Its claim to fame is as the first cryptocurrency.
             It was started back in 2009 by a mysterious figure or entity only known as Satoshi Nakamoto.
             <b>No one has substantial evidence as to who Satoshi Nakamoto is.</b> Isn't that crazy??
             When Bitcoin hit its all-time high back in December 2017, Satoshi Nakamoto's estimated
             net-worth based off the number of bitcoin he/she/they/it own (~1 million BTC) was $19.4 billion,
             making Satoshi the 44th richest person in the world.

               There are literally over a thousand cryptocurrencies, and that's why I say the name is somewhat of a misnomer (
                 Most people agree that we don't need this many currencies...
               ) There are a few currencies out there that either look to dethrone Bitcoin or extend upon its concept.
                For example, Litecoin (LTC) believes that its transactions are much faster than Bitcoin's.
                Ethereum (ETH) looks to act more as a "world computer" rather than as a form of currency. However, the main aspect
                that all these currencies share is they are all based off of a digital coin type model.
